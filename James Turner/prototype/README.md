James Turner Socket.io and Johnny-Five Prototype

This is a simple prototype testing connectivity and feedback through electronics. This project attempts to make a light or vibrator activate for User B when User A interacts with a button.

Why is this useful?

My aim is to impliment aspects of our Plant as Proxy project. It can be used to inform design choices in regard to time delay and forms of feeback, while also providing a prototype to be used in user testing.

Dependencies:

node.js socket.io Johnny-Five express

How to use:

npm insall all dependences run the local server with node

Source:

This prototype is loosely based on my work with Andrew Errity's button example: https://github.com/aerrity/socket-click-example It was also informed by my work with the Socket.io getting started chat example: https://socket.io/get-started/chat#Getting-this-example
