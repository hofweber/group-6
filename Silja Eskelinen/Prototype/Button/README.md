Silja Eskelinen Socket.io Connectivity Prototype

This is a simple prototype testing connectivity and feedback through browser. Prototype aims to use pressure touch as a form of communication between users across the browser.

My aim is to impliment aspects of our Plant as Proxy project. It can be used to inform design choices in regard to time delay and forms of feeback, while also providing a prototype to be used in user testing.

Libraries used:

node.js 
socket.io 
chrome.js
pressure.s

How to use:

npm insall all dependences run the local server with node

Using pressure and chrome to communicate touching was inspired from interactivity prototype inspared by a example from Clint Heyer:
